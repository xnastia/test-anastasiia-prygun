        Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
        sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
        it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
        hanging from the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
        There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
        wondering how she was ever to get out again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; th");
            WriteLiteral(@"ere was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one
        of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came
        upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!
    </p>
    <p>
        Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How
        she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if
        my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, ");
            WriteLiteral(@"how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how
        to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
