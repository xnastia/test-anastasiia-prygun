        There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting 
        people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with 
        the words `DRINK ME' beautifully printed on it in large letters.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked ""poison"" or not';
        for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the 
        simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you");
            WriteLiteral(@" cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually
        bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked `poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, 
        roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.
    </p>
